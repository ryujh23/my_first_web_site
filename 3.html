      A wind instrument made from a tube with holes
      along it that are stopped by the fingers or keys,
      held vertically or horizontally so that the
      player's breath strikes a narrow edge. The modern
      orchestral form, typically made of metal, is held
      horizontally and has an elaborate set of keys.
